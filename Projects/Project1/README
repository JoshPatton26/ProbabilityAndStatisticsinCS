CS355 Probability and Statistics in CS: Project 1 Shuffiing Cards Using Two Different Methods

In this assignment I was tasked to create a program that would simulate the shuffling of a 
deck of 52 cards using two different methods. For this program we were told to work in groups 
and split up the work accordingly. I was grouped with Vaishak Menon, a classmate from UAB.

The first method we were asked to use wanted us to split the deck in half to produce two 
subdecks (1-26 and 27-52). Now they wanted us to select the first card from each deck, starting 
with the subdeck that has the first half of the cards to begin the shuffle, and continuing this 
approach until you reach the end of the subdecks. The first card of this shuffle should be 1 and
the last card should be 52. The assignment then asked us to answer some questions based off our 
results.

The second method asked us to begin with a new deck of cards, and repeat the same method except
this time we are supposed to start pulling cards from the subdeck with the second half of the 
cards in it. In this result the last cards will be 52 followed by 26. The assignment again asked 
us questions based off our results.

To see the questions that we were asked and to get more information about the program expectations
and calculations, please refer to Program I.pdf in this repository.

To run this program you might have to pip install python's "matplotlib.pyplot" library to get the 
program to function properly. I ran mine on VS Code however it shouldn't have any issues running on 
any other IDE, but hasn't been tested.
