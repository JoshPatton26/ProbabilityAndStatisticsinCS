# Probability and Statistics in CS

This repository contains all the work I have done in my 'CS355 Statistics and Probability in CS' course 
at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. A majority of the work in the class was done using paper and 
pen, however, he did assign us a few coding assignments as well. All homeworks were completed by myself 
and all the projects were completed in a group of 2 people. My groupmate was Vaishak Menon, a CS student
from UAB. 

The entire repository was written Python 3.10.5 while being interpreted and executed using VSCode as our
IDE. We only used the basic Python libraries so nothing more than installing the required libraries should 
be required to run these programs on another computer.
